- How to run the benchmark (run parallelCal as an example)

  0. // copy benchmark folder to your pthread library directory and make your pthread
  1. ./make
  2. ./parallelCal 6 (which means create 6 user-level threads to run parallelCal. You could change this parameter to test how thread numbers
                      affect performance)


- You're free to modify makefile in Benchmark if you add new files in your pthread library


- To run each benchmark, if the result is same with the verified result (doing the same thing in a single thread), then your thread library
  is good


- Before running externalCal, run genRecord.sh first to generate some random records.
